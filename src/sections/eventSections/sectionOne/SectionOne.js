                        <h5>Visitation to Goodswill school</h5>
                        <p><i>Tuesday, November 19th 2024</i></p>
                        <p>On this day, the NAPTIP CDS group visited Goodswill Secondary School as part of
                            our ongoing community sensitization campaigns. The visit aimed to educate students
                            and teachers about the dangers of human trafficking and the importance of prevention.
                            Our president kicked off the event with an impactful introductory speech, outlining NAPTIPâ€™s
                            mission and efforts. <br />

                            Throughout the event, various CDS members took turns speaking and sensitizing the audience,
                            providing diverse perspectives and valuable insights. The highlight of the day was a powerful drama
                            performed by our CDS members. <br /> The play depicted a scenario where a student named Aisha, portrayed by Cynthia,
                            was being lured into trafficking by Brother Solomon, played by Midestic_JS. <br /> The drama underscored the
                            manipulative tactics traffickers use and the critical role of vigilance and timely reporting.
                            The visit was a success, leaving a lasting impression on the students and teachers,
                            and reinforcing our commitment to combating human trafficking through education and awareness. </p>
