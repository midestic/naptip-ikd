            <h5>Visitation to Goodswill school</h5>
            <p>
              <i>Tuesday, November 19th 2024</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              On this day, the NAPTIP CDS group visited Goodswill Secondary
              School as part of our ongoing community sensitization campaigns.
              The visit aimed to educate students and teachers about the dangers
              of human trafficking and the importance of prevention. Our
              president kicked off the event with an impactful introductory
              speech, outlining NAPTIPâ€™s mission and efforts. <br />
              Throughout the event, various CDS members took turns speaking and
              sensitizing the audience, providing diverse perspectives and
              valuable insights. The highlight of the day was a powerful drama
              performed by our CDS members. <br /> The play depicted a scenario
              where a student named Aisha, portrayed by Cynthia, was being lured
              into trafficking by Brother Solomon, played by Midestic_JS. <br />{" "}
              The drama underscored the manipulative tactics traffickers use and
              the critical role of vigilance and timely reporting. The visit was
              a success, leaving a lasting impression on the students and
              teachers, and reinforcing our commitment to combating human
              trafficking through education and awareness.{" "}
